# My Personal Project

## Phase 0

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My application is going to be a workout planner,
that allows you to go on to each day of the week and add/remove 
specific workouts. In those workouts you can specify the muscle group
it hits. You can also add a set, a set will contain the number of reps to do in the set
along with the percent of your one rep max weight to lift
There will also be an area to add additional notes. The target audience for this app
will be athletes and bodybuilders. This project is important to me 
because working out is a huge part of my lifestyle and having an app
like this will easily allow me to track my workouts and design workout plans.
