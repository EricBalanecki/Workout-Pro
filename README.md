# My Personal Project

## Phase 0

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My application is going to be a workout planner,
that allows you to go on to each day of the week and add/remove 
specific workouts. In those workouts you can specify the muscle group
it hits, the number of sets you want to do, and the number of reps per set.
There will also be an area to add additional notes. The target audience for this app
will be athletes and bodybuilders. This project is important to me 
because working out is a huge part of my lifestyle and having an app
like this will easily allow me to track my workouts and design workout plans.
